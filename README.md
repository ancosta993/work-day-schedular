## Introduction
This application keeps track of events assigned to each of the 24 hours of the current day to help the user manage time effectively. 

## Function

- User is presented with time blocks representing one hour.
- Blocks are color coded:
  - Gray blocks represents past hours.
  - Red block represent current hour.
  - Green block represent future hour.
- Clicking on each block allows the user to enter text in the block.
- The text can be saved by clicking the save button shown at the end of each block.
- The text can be edited by re-clicking the same time block and saving it.
- All the data are stored in the browser storage.
